Neuralink has developed an innovative application that translates a user's intended movements into computer commands. This is achieved by decoding brain signals captured by the Neuralink N1 Implant, effectively enabling control of a computer through thought alone. This groundbreaking technology represents a significant step forward in brain-computer interfaces, offering potential applications for individuals with motor impairments and opening new avenues for human-computer interaction.
